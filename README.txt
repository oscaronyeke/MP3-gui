For this program to run you first have to go into the file and run the program from MusicSharingGUI.java. This can be
found by going into the source file, then into main, then java, and lastly gui. Click on MusicSharingGUI and run it.
Once you run the program a login screen should appear. It will ask you for you username and password. For now you
and enter the username "username" and the password "password". If the username or password are either incorrect
or if the user does not exist then text will appear to inform the user. If all fields are correctly entered press the
"Sign In" button which will close the screen, causing a new screen will appear. The first screen contains the title
called playlist which displays a list of playlist that the user owns. Pressing one of the playlist will advance you
to a new screen which displays all songs contained in the playlist. To go back to the original screen click "Playlist"
on the side bar. This side bar is also able to take you to two other screens those being the Album page and the Artist
page. When you click on "Album" it displays a list of all albums in the database. When you click on a particular album
the name of the creator of the album as well as a list of songs in the album are displayed. Now back to the side bar if
you click on the artist button you will be shown an entire list of all artists in the data base. If you click on a
particular artist you will be taken to a screen that shows the name of the artist, their popularity, and the genre of
music they produce. With that all of the functionality of the program has been described and if you are done with the
program you can close it by clicking on the "x" in the top right corner.
